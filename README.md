> [!NOTE]
> **This is a fork of [chen08209/FlClash](https://github.com/chen08209/FlClash).** Many thanks to the upstream author. What the fork adds is listed here; the original README follows below.

## What this fork adds

- **Custom routing** (Advanced config → Custom routing, picked per profile under Profile → Extend)
  - Visual rule editor: domain suffix / keyword / exact domain, IP-CIDR(6), GEOSITE, GEOIP, process name, rule sets and more, combined with OR / AND
  - A separate outbound per entry (policy, group or single node); a missing outbound is marked red and skipped
  - Injected **in front of** the profile's rules in list order; drag to reorder, toggle, and duplicate (the copy is named "name copy")
- **Extend tab layout**: custom routing is its own tab, placed before Standard / Script and selected by default, without changing the profile's mode
- **Visual Tailscale** (Advanced config → Tailscale)
  - Auth-key or browser-URL login (copy / open the URL), with login status and the real error
  - **Connection proxy**: Tailscale's own control-server / DERP traffic can go through a chosen group or node, for networks that cannot reach the control server directly
  - This device's tailnet IPs and every peer (online, OS, exit-node capability), with search, copy IP and one-tap "add to custom routing" (MagicDNS name plus IPv4/IPv6 in one OR rule)
  - Injects front rules for 100.64.0.0/10, fd7a:115c:a1e9::/48 and ts.net plus MagicDNS resolution; logout & reset clears the login state

### Download

Get builds from this fork's [Releases](https://github.com/KarenGarcia484134/FlClash/releases). Stable releases come from `v*` tags; `build-…` releases are development previews.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Android package is still `com.follow.clash` but signed with a different key, so **uninstall the official FlClash first** (back up your settings in the app beforehand). APKs carry v1/v2/v3 signatures.

### How releases are built

[`.github/workflows/release.yaml`](.github/workflows/release.yaml): pushing a `v*` tag publishes a stable release; running the workflow manually (`workflow_dispatch`) lets you skip desktop builds and override the version with the `version` input (blank uses `pubspec.yaml`). Android APKs are re-signed and their v1/v2/v3 signatures verified before upload.

### Patched core

The `core/Clash.Meta` submodule points at the `FlClash-patched` branch of [KarenGarcia484134/Clash.Meta](https://github.com/KarenGarcia484134/Clash.Meta): upstream's `FlClash` branch plus one **added** file that exposes Tailscale node status and keeps one node across config reloads. See [`core/PATCHES.md`](core/PATCHES.md) for details and how to sync with upstream.

## Features

- **One app for Android, Windows, macOS and Linux**, with x64 and ARM64 builds on the desktop.
- **mihomo (Clash.Meta) core** with rule routing, proxy groups, latency tests, system proxy and TUN mode.
- **Profiles** from a subscription link or a file, with a built-in editor, override scripts, and custom rules,
  proxies and proxy groups.
- **Live views** of connections, requests, DNS queries and logs.
- **Material You design with Apple-style interaction**: dynamic color, light and dark themes, continuous corners,
  sheets that snap between heights, and layouts that adapt from phones to desktops.
- **Backup and restore** through WebDAV or a local file.
- **Platform touches**: a Quick Settings tile, per-app proxy and Android TV support on Android; a tray menu and
  global hotkeys on the desktop.
- **Open source and ad-free**, licensed under GPL-3.0.

## Download

Get the latest build from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/chen08209/FlClash/releases/latest), or open the
[website](https://chen08209.github.io/FlClash#download), which picks the right file for your device.

| Platform | Packages | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Android | APK for `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a` and `x86_64` | Most phones use `arm64-v8a`. Also on the F-Droid repository below. |
| Windows 10 and later | Installer (`.exe`) or portable `.zip`, for x64 and ARM64 | Pick ARM64 on Snapdragon and other ARM laptops. |
| macOS 12 and later | DMG for Apple Silicon and Intel | Also on Homebrew. |
| Linux | `.deb`, `.rpm` and AppImage, for x64 and ARM64 | See the tray note below. |

</p>

**Homebrew**

```bash
brew tap chen08209/tap
brew install --cask flclash
```

**Linux tray icon**

The `.deb` package installs its own dependencies. With the AppImage or the `.rpm`, install the AyatanaAppIndicator
library so the tray icon can show:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libayatana-appindicator3-1   # Debian and Ubuntu
sudo dnf install libayatana-appindicator-gtk3     # Fedora
```

## Usage

**Import a profile from a link.** Opening a link in this form imports the subscription into FlClash. The `clashmeta://`
and `flclash://` schemes work the same way.

```text
clash://install-config?url=<URL-encoded subscription link>
```

**Automate on Android.** Tasker, MacroDroid and similar apps can start, stop or toggle the proxy by starting an
activity with one of these actions:

```text
com.follow.clash.action.START
com.follow.clash.action.STOP
com.follow.clash.action.TOGGLE
```

From a computer, the same works over adb:

```bash
adb shell am start -a com.follow.clash.action.TOGGLE
```

## Build from source

You need [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) 3.47 (release builds use 3.47.6),
[Go](https://go.dev/dl/) 1.27 and [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) installed through rustup. Each platform builds on its own
host, except Android, which builds anywhere.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/chen08209/FlClash.git
cd FlClash
flutter pub get
dart setup.dart android   # or windows, macos, linux
```

Packages land in `dist/`. The Go core and the Rust libraries are compiled as part of the Flutter build.

| Platform | Also needed |
| --- | --- |
| Android | Android SDK with the NDK. Add `--arch arm64` to build a single ABI. |
| Windows | GCC (MinGW-w64) for the core and [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) 6 for the installer. |
| macOS | Xcode and Node.js. The script installs `appdmg` through npm. |
| Linux | Debian or Ubuntu. The script installs the build packages with apt and downloads `appimagetool`. |

Run `dart setup.dart --help` for the remaining options, such as `--targets` to build only some package formats.
